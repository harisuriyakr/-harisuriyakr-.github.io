### Note: I will not maintain this anymore. I unfortunately don't have enough time to work on new features and bugfixes.
I started this as a side project and it brought itself to life, with many people seeing different uses to this, in ways completely different from what it was originally supposed to do. I may sometime in the uncertain future re-do this from the ground up to attain to those possibilities, but currently I don't have enough time to work on this, sorry. If you want to help with anything, feel free to open pull requests.
